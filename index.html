                <h2>Camera and Image Usage</h2>
                <p>VibeAI requires access to the camera to analyze images and messages to generate personalized responses. Images and messages are processed within the app and are not permanently stored on our servers.</p>

            <!-- Facial Analysis -->
            <section id="face-analysis">
                <h2>Facial Analysis</h2>
                <p>
                    If you choose to use the facial analysis feature, VibeAI may temporarily process images that contain a face. 
                    These images are used solely to generate contextual responses and suggestions (such as personal care or makeup tips). 
                    We do not collect or create biometric identifiers, faceprints, or facial recognition templates. 
                    Processing occurs securely and only in temporary memory for the duration of the analysis. 
                    The images are not permanently stored on our servers or on the device once the analysis is completed, 
                    and they are not shared with third parties.
